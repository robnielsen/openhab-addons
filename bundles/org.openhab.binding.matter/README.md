# Matter Binding

The Matter Binding for openHAB allows seamless integration with Matter-compatible devices.

**Please note this binding requires openHAB 4.3 snapshot builds or later that support discovery codes when searching for devices.** 

## Supported modes

This binding supports 2 different types of matter functionality.

- A Matter client
  - This allows openHAB to discover and control other Matter devices like lights, thermostats, window coverings, locks, etc...
  - See [Matter Binding Configuration](#matter-binding-configuration) for configuring a matter controller.
- A Matter Bridge
  - This allows openHAB to expose items as Matter devices to other Matter clients.  This allows local control of openHAB devices from other ecosystems like Apple Home, Amazon, and Google Home.
  - This is considered experimental and is still a work in progress.
  - See [Matter Bridge](#matter-bridge) for information on configuring a bridge.

This binding uses the excellent [matter.js](https://github.com/project-chip/matter.js) implementation of the the Matter 1.3 protocol.

Please read this document in its entirety as Matter is a complex protocol with very specific requirements.

# General Matter Ecosystem Overview

Matter is an open-source connectivity standard for smart home devices, allowing seamless communication between a wide range of devices, controllers, and ecosystems. 

Below is a high-level overview of the Matter ecosystem as well as common terminology used in the Matter standard.

## Matter and IPv6

Matter **requires** IPv6 to be enabled and be routable between openHAB and the Matter device.  This means IPv6 needs to be enabled on the host openHAB is running, and the network must be able route IPv6 unicast and multicast messages.  Docker, VLANs, subnets and other configurations can prohibit Matter from working if not configured correctly. See the [IPv6 Requirements](#IPv6-Requirements) section for more information.

## Matter Devices

### Nodes and Endpoints

In the Matter ecosystem, a **node** represents a single device that joins a Matter network and will have a locally routable IPv6 address. A **node** can have multiple **endpoints**, which are logical representations of specific features or functionalities of the device. For example, a smart thermostat (node) may have an endpoint for general thermostat control (heating, cooling, current temperature, operating state, etc....) and another endpoint for humidity sensing.  Many devices will only have a single endpoint.  [Matter Bridges](#bridges) will expose multiple endpoints for each device they are bridging, and the bridge itself will be a node.

**Example:**
- A Thermostat node with an endpoint for general temperature control and another endpoint for a remote temperature or humidity sensor.

### Controllers

A **controller** manages the interaction between Matter devices and other parts of the network. Controllers can send commands, receive updates, and facilitate device communication. They also handle the commissioning process when new devices are added to the network.

**Example:**
- openHAB or another smart home hub or a smartphone app that manages your smart light bulbs, door locks, and sensors (Google Home, Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, etc...)

### Bridges

A **bridge** is a special type of node that connects non-Matter devices to a Matter network, effectively translating between protocols. Bridges allow legacy devices to be controlled via the Matter standard.

openHAB fully supports connecting to Matter bridges. In addition, openHAB has experimental support for running its own Matter bridge service, exposing openHAB items as Matter endpoints to 3rd party systems.  See [Matter Bridge](#Matter-Bridge) for information on running a Bridge server. 

**Example:**
- A bridge that connects Zigbee or Z-Wave devices, making them accessible within a Matter ecosystem. The Ikea Dirigera and Philips Hue Bridge both act as matter bridges and are supported in openHAB.

### Thread Border Routers

A **Thread Border Router** is a device that allows devices connected via Thread (a low-power wireless protocol) to communicate with devices on other networks, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet. It facilitates IPv6-based communication between Thread networks and the local IP network.

**Example:**
- An Open Thread Boarder Router (open source) as well as recent versions of Apple TVs, Amazon Echos and Google Nest Hubs all have embedded thread boarder routers. 

## IPv6 and Network Connectivity

Matter devices operate over an IPv6 network, and obtaining an IPv6 address is required for communication. Devices can connect to the network via different interfaces:

### Ethernet
Ethernet-connected Matter devices receive an IPv6 address through standard DHCPv6 or stateless address auto-configuration (SLAAC).

### Wi-Fi
Wi-Fi-enabled Matter devices also receive an IPv6 address using DHCPv6 or SLAAC. They rely on the existing Wi-Fi infrastructure for communication within the Matter ecosystem.

### Thread
Thread-based Matter devices connect to the network via a **Thread Border Router**. They receive an IPv6 address from the Thread router

## IPv6 Requirements

For Matter devices to function correctly, **IPv6 must be enabled** and supported in both the local network (router) and the Matter controllers. Without IPv6, devices won’t be able to communicate properly within the Matter ecosystem. Ensure that your router has IPv6 enabled and that any Matter controllers (like smart hubs, apps or openHAB) are configured to support IPv6 as well.

**Note that environments like Docker require special configurations to enable IPv6**

### Enabling IPv6 Thread Connectivity on Linux Hosts
It is important to make sure that Route Announcements (RA) and Route Information Options (RIO) are enabled on your host so that Thread boarder routers can announce routes to the Thread network. 
This is done by setting the following sysctl options:

1. `net.ipv6.conf.wlan0.accept_ra` should be at least `1` if ip forwarding is not enabled, and `2` otherwise.
2. `net.ipv6.conf.wlan0.accept_ra_rt_info_max_plen` should not be smaller than `64`.

the `accept_ra` is defaulted to `1` for most distributions. 

There may be other network daemons which will override this option (for example, dhcpcd on Raspberry Pi will override accept_ra to 0). 

You can check the accept_ra value with:
```
$ sudo sysctl -n net.ipv6.conf.wlan0.accept_ra
0
```

And set the value to 1 (or 2 in case IP forwarding is enabled) with:
```
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.wlan0.accept_ra=1
Net.ipv6.conf.wlan0.accept_ra = 1
```

The accept_ra_rt_info_max_plen option on most Linux distributions is default to 0, set it to 64 with:
```
$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.wlan0.accept_ra_rt_info_max_plen=64
net.ipv6.conf.wlan0.accept_ra_rt_info_max_plen = 64
```

To make these changes permanent, add the following lines to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:
```
net.ipv6.conf.eth0.accept_ra=1
net.ipv6.conf.eth0.accept_ra_rt_info_max_plen=64
```

Raspberry Pi users may need to add the following lines to `/etc/dhcpcd.conf` to prevent dhcpcd from overriding the accept_ra value:
```
noipv6
noipv6rs
```

***NOTE:  Please ensure you use the right interface name for your network interface.*** The above examples use `wlan0` and `eth0` as examples.  You can find the correct interface name by running `ip a` and looking for the interface that has an IPv6 address assigned to it. 

## Matter Commissioning and Pairing Codes

Commissioning a Matter device involves securely adding it to the network using a **pairing code**. This process ensures that only authorized devices can join the network.

### Pairing Code from the Device
When commissioning a new Matter device, it typically has a printed QR code or numeric pairing code that you scan or enter during setup. This pairing code allows the controller to establish a secure connection to the device and add it to the network. Once a device pairing code is in use, it can not be used again to pair other controllers.

### Additional Pairing Code from a Controller
If a device has already been commissioned and you want to add it to another Matter controller, the existing controller can generate an additional pairing code. This is useful when sharing access to a device across multiple hubs or apps. Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa and openHAB all support generating pairing codes for existing paired devices.

### Example:
- When setting up a smart lock, you may scan a QR code directly from the lock, or use the 11 digit pairing code printed on it to pair it with openHAB. If you later want to control the lock from another app or hub, you would retrieve a new pairing code directly from openHAB.

# Matter Binding Configuration

This describes the Matter controller functionality for discovering and controller other Matter devices.

## Supported Things

The Matter Binding supports the following types of things:

- `controller`: The main controller that interfaces with Matter devices. It requires the configuration parameter  `nodeId` which sets the local Matter node ID for this controller (must be unique in the fabric).
- `node`: Represents an individual Node within the Matter network. The only configuration parameter is `nodeId`.
- `bridge-endpoint`: Represents an individual bridged endpoint as a child of a `node` thing. Configuration parameters include `endpointId`.

## Discovery

Matter controllers must be added manually.  Nodes (devices) will be discovered when a `pairCode` is used to search for a device to add. 
Bridged endpoints will be added to the inbox once the parent Node is added as a thing.

### Device Pairing: General

In order to pair a device, you must have an 11 digit manual pairing code (eg 123-4567-8901 or 12345678901) or a QR Code (eg MT:ABCDEF1234567890123).  If the device has not been paired before, use the code provided by the manufacturer and **ensure the device is in pairing mode**, refer to your devices instructions for pairing for more information.

If the device is paired with another Matter ecosystem (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc..) use that ecosystem to generate a pairing code and search for devices.  The pairing code and device will only be available for commissioning for a limited time.  Refer to the ecosystem that generated the code for the exact duration (typically 1-15 minutes).

When using the discovery feature of openHAB use the provided code in the text entry box before pushing "scan"

### Device Pairing: Thread Devices

Thread devices require a Thread Border Router and a bluetooth enabled device to facilitate the thread joining process (typically a mobile device).  Until there is a supported thread border router integration in openHAB and the openHAB mobile apps, it's strongly recommended to pair the device to a commercial router with thread support first (Apple TV 4k, Google Nest Hub 2, Amazon Gen 4 Echo, etc... ), then generate a matter pairing code and add the device normally.  This will still allow openHAB to have direct access to the device using only the embedded thread border router and does not interact with the underlying providers home automation stack.

Support for using a Open Thread Border Router has been verified to work and will be coming soon to openHAB, but in some cases requires strong expertise in IPv6 routing as well as support in our mobile clients. 

## Binding Configuration

This binding does not require any general configuration settings.

# Matter Bridge

openHAB can also expose Items and Item groups as Matter devices to 3rd party Matter clients like Google Home, Apple Home and Amazon Alexa. This allows local control for those ecosystems and can be used instead of cloud based integrations for features like voice assistants. 

## Configuration

The openHAB matter bridge uses Metadata tags with the key "matter", similar to the Alexa, Google Assistant and Apple Homekit integrations.  Matter Metadata tag values generally follow the Matter "Device Type" and "Cluster" specification as much as possible.  Items and item groups are initially tagged with a Matter "Device Type", which are Matter designations for common device types like lights, thermostats, locks, window coverings, etc... For single items, like a light switch or dimmer, simply tagging the item with the Matter device type is enough.  For more complicated devices, like thermostats, A group item is tagged with the device type, and its child members are tagged with the cluster attribute(s) that it will be associated with.  Multiple attributes use a comma delimited format like `attribute1, attribute2, ... attributeN`

Pairing codes and other options can be found in the MainUI under "Settings -> Add-on Settings -> Matter Binding"

### Global Options

* Endpoint Labels
  *  By default, the Item label is used as the Matter label but can be overridden by adding a `label` key as a metadata option, either by itself or part of other options required for a device.
  * Example: `[label="My Custom Label"]`
* Fixed Labels
  * Matter has a concept of "Fixed Labels" which allows devices to expose arbitrary label names and values which can be used by clients for tasks like grouping devices in rooms.
  * Example: `[fixedLabels="room=Office, floor=1"]`

For `systemMode` the `ON` option should map to the system mode custom value that would be appropriate if a 'ON' command was issued, defaults to the `AUTO` mapping.

The following attributes can be set in the options of any thermostat member or on the Group item to set temperature options
